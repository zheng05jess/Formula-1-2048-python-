F1 2048 description:

In the original 2048, players will use the arrow keys to “slide” tiles towards each other where two tiles with the same number on them will become one tile with a value of the number doubled. Every time the arrow is clicked, a new tile will also appear consisting of either the lowest value or the second to lowest value. In my project’s edition of 2048, the original numbers displayed on the tiles will instead be transformed into the Formula 1 racing team logos. These teams will be ordered in regards to their current F1 constructor’s championship order with 10th place being the lowest and 1st place being the highest tile achievable. My project also has the option to choose “difficulty levels”. Different F1 seasons with different team rankings and scores are possible to play as well. A hint button is also included to maximize the player's score. The game is over once all cells in the board are filled with team tiles.
